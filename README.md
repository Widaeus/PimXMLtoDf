This package is intended for importing multiple XML files as single row observations into a dataframe.
        It can also be used on a folder of XML files. It is based on the package xml2 and tidyvserse based packages.
        It includes two functions "xml_to_singlerow" and "singlerow_df_compile".
        "xml_to_singlerow" takes a xml file path and generates a single row tibble df. "singlerow_df_compile" takes a file path to a folder of XML files and compiles all of them into a data frame.
